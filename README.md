# Music-Recommendation-System

## Overview
A hybrid music recommendation engine built using content-based and collaborative filtering. It personalizes suggestions based on song metadata, genre similarity, and popularityâ€”emulating functionality similar to Spotify.

## Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (Visualization)
- t-SNE for dimensionality reduction
- CountVectorizer, Cosine Similarity

## Recommendation Techniques
- Content-Based Filtering  
- Feature Engineering (e.g., converting popularity to rating scale)  
- Similarity computation using Cosine Similarity

## Features
- Dataset preprocessing and cleaning  
- Visualizations for song trends and popularity  
- Real-time music recommendations  
- Clustering with t-SNE for better insight  
- Histogram and scatter plots of features

## Objective
To build a smart music engine that transforms the listening experience with intelligent, diverse, and evolving music recommendations based on user preferences and song characteristics.
